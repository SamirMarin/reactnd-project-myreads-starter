## Backend Server

The backend server was provided by udacity. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend:


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
